    "# The Price Is Right\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to examine the impacts of different cost functions on specific problems we are going to use an example from the gameshow The Price is Right. In the first round of The Price is Right, 4 contestants \"Come on down!\" to play against each other. They are given an item and asked to guess how much it costs. If the contestant goes over the price, they automatically lose. The winner is the contestant with the guess that is closest to the actual price without going over.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "So what if we want to maximize our chances of winning on The Price is Right? Well as a data scientist we might think that this is the perfect chance to train a model to make predictions for us. We need to build a model that gets as close to the correct price as possible without going over. We are going to explore how we can use cost functions to build the best model possible.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We are using data from the Amazon Toy Dataset to train and test on. With the price as our target variable, I have taken the liberty of building our exogenous variables using NLP and some basic data cleaning on a set of descriptions, reviews, and information for each product.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this experiment we are going to use a very popular algorithm, [LightGBM from Microsoft](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). With LightGBM, we are going to explore several different functions to try to optimize our results. We are going to use the basic MAE and MSE along with some custom objective and evaluation functions of our own to see which one works best.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate our \"winnings\" on The Price is Right, we are going to calculate them as follows. If a prediction is over the true value, our winnings are 0. If our prediction is below the true value, then our winnings are equal to our prediction. For example, if an item was worth $10 and we predicted it was worth 7, we would win 7 dollars. This will encourage us to not only predict under the actual value, but still predict as close to the value as possible."

The 2 functions that we will look at that are already supported by LightGBM are the [Mean Absolute Error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_absolute_error) and the [Mean Squared Error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_error). We are also going to write a few of our own functions to try to get the most out of our model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "With LightGBM there are 2 different types of functions that we need to write. The first one is an objective function for training. This function needs to be compatible with the [gradient descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent) used to optimize the model. LightGBM requires objective functions to return both the first and second derivative of the cost function.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The second type of function that we can use with LightGBM is an evaluation function. This function is how we will optimize our models parameters with our validation data during training. So while updating weights based on the objective function, the model will run until the score of our evaluation function stops improving. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most of these functions are going to be some variation of the MAE or MSE cost functions mentioned above. The difference is that we are going to add extra penalties if the model predicts above the true value. You will see that we are going to run these experiments several times with different penalties to see how the model is impacted.  \n",
